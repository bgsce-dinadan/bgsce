# Buffout

## Buffout 4

- fixes engine bugs
- crash log
- enable achievements
- gamepad input auto-switch
- faster workshop menu

Includes the features of (and therefore supercedes) ...

- Private Profile Redirector | Stores ini config files in memory. (Already integrated into Buffout 4.)
There are two additional mods whose usefulness alongside Buffout 4 is currently debated:
- xSE Plugin Preloader | Preloads F4SE plugins before the game starts. (Even though it's noted as required, Buffout 4 functions perfectly fine without it.)
- Baka Scrapheap | Game memory expansion and management. (When used, disable Buffout 4's Memory Manager and set Baka's memory multiplier to 4.)

### Configuration

Open the config.toml (or Buffout4.toml) file with a text editor, then change the following parameters if needed:

- If you'd like faster switching between your Controller and KB/M, set the InputSwitch line to true.
(This can rarely cause weird behavior. Not needed if you are not using a Controller / Gamepad.)

- If you have mods that already enable achievements, set the Achievements line to false.
(If you still have problems getting Achievements, remove those mods and only let Buffout do it.)

- If you have Baka ScrapHeap mod installed, set the MemoryManager line to false.
(Then go to Fallout 4\Data\F4SE\Plugins, open BakaScrapHeap.toml and set ScrapHeapMult to 4)

- If you have Looks Menu mod (latest version) installed, set the F4EE line to true.
(If you have both AAF and older Looks Menu 1.6.18 version installed, this edit is likely not needed.)
